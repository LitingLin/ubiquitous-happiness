         <bbox_left>	     The x coordinate of the top-left corner of the predicted bounding box

         <bbox_top>	     The y coordinate of the top-left corner of the predicted object bounding box

         <bbox_width>	     The width in pixels of the predicted object bounding box

        <bbox_height>	     The height in pixels of the predicted object bounding box

           <score>	     The score in the DETECTION file indicates the confidence of the predicted bounding box enclosing 
                             an object instance.
                             The score in GROUNDTRUTH file is set to 1 or 0. 1 indicates the bounding box is considered in evaluation, 
                             while 0 indicates the bounding box will be ignored.

        <object_category>    The object category indicates the type of annotated object, (i.e., ignored regions(0), pedestrian(1), 
                             people(2), bicycle(3), car(4), van(5), truck(6), tricycle(7), awning-tricycle(8), bus(9), motor(10), 
                             others(11))

        <truncation>	     The score in the DETECTION result file should be set to the constant -1.
                             The score in the GROUNDTRUTH file indicates the degree of object parts appears outside a frame 
                             (i.e., no truncation = 0 (truncation ratio 0%), and partial truncation = 1 (truncation ratio 1% ~ 50%)).

        <occlusion>	     The score in the DETECTION file should be set to the constant -1.
                             The score in the GROUNDTRUTH file indicates the fraction of objects being occluded (i.e., no occlusion = 0 
                             (occlusion ratio 0%), partial occlusion = 1 (occlusion ratio 1% ~ 50%), and heavy occlusion = 2 
                             (occlusion ratio 50% ~ 100%)).
