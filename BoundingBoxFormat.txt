Bounding Box:
Bounding box select the pixels in various formats

The convention applied in my project:

Coordinate locate on the edge of a pixel
(0,0)
↓
--- x
|*|
---
y ↑
  (1,1)
*: pixel
XY: left/top coordinate point of the pixels selected
Width Height: Number of pixels selected

XYWH format: [0, 0, 1, 1]
CXCYWH format: [0.5, 0.5, 1, 1]
XYXY format: [0, 0, 1, 1]


Normalized Bounding Box:
bounding box / image size


When using some external libs, like opencv, be careful about the *difference* between coordinate system!
Usually, their coordinate points locate *in* pixels.


Handling with resize(up sample/down sample)

align_corners=Ture meet with bounding box * scaling ratio, so align_corners=Ture provides better performance
