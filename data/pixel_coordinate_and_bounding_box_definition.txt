    2. pixels center is at (x, y)
    comments:
        a) 1. assumes that pixel represent a 1*1 rectangle, center located at (0.5 + x, 0.5 + y)
        b) 2. assumes that pixel represent a point
    See pdf for more details, 1. just like d3d10 behaviour, 2. is the d3d9 one.

Bounding Box:
    1. around pixels, consisting of lines
    2. edge pixels themselves

        a) 1. sounds more mathematically correct
        b) 2. is used in rasterization process
